<<_overriding_attributes,Attribute overriding>> is the act of replacing existing attributes with a new value.

When ingesting from the <<_content_directory_monitor,Content Directory Monitor>>, attribute overrides can be configured by <<_configuring_the_content_directory_monitor,configuring the Content Directory Monitor>>.

When querying from certain <<_connecting_to_sources,sources>>, attribute overrides can be configured for these specific source types:

* <<_federated_source_for_atlassian_confluence_r,Federated Source for Atlassian Confluence>>
* <<_csw_specification_profile_federated_source,CSW Specification Profile Federated Source>>
* <<_gmd_csw_source,GMD CSW Federated Source>>

[NOTE]
====
If an attempt is made to override an attribute that has not been injected, the attribute will not be added to the metacard.
See <<_attributes_added_by_attribute_injection,attributes added by attribute injection>> for more information about injecting attributes.
