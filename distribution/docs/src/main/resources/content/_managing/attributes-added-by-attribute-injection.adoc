<<_injecting_attributes,Attribute injection>> is the process of creating a new attribute on a metacard.
This capability allows metacard types to be extended with new attributes.

Injected attributes can have corresponding default values, however these default values are only set during ingest.
For a list of attributes injected by default, see <<_catalog_taxonomy_definitions,catalog taxonomy definitions>>.
To learn how to configure your own attribute injections, see <<_developing_attribute_injections,developing attribute injections>>.

[NOTE]
====
If an attempt is made to inject an attribute that already exists, the attribute will retain the original value.
