<<_injecting_attributes,Attribute Injection>> is the process of adding attributes to a metacard.
This capability allows metacard types to be extended with new attributes.

Injected attributes can have corresponding default values, however these default values are only set during ingest.
For a list of attributes injected by default, see <<_catalog_taxonomy_definitions,Catalog Taxonomy Definitions>>.
To learn how to configure attribute injections, see <<_developing_attribute_injections,Developing Attribute Injections>>.

[NOTE]
====
If an attempt is made to inject an attribute that already exists, the attribute will retain the original value.
